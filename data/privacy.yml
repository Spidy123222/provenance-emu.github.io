        SideStore and other apps published by SideStore LLC, do not collect any personal or identifying information whatsoever. For analytics purposes, we may record device models and iOS versions used, but this is completely anonymous and contains no identifying information.
        SideStore requires using your Apple ID email address and password in order to sign-in with Apple and configure your account for sideloading apps (for more information on why this is needed, see the SideStore FAQ). These credentials are sent to Apple via Sideloady's annisete data server and no one else — then this data is securely stored in your iOS device’s keychain for later use. In other words, No one ever see's your email address or password, since they are stored on-device and never sent to anyone.
